# Learning Backbones

Yet another todo mvc sample with other friends:

* requirejs
* handlebars
* bower
* grunt


## Setup and Run

```
npm install .
bower install .
grunt
```

## Automation

`grunt` is required because handlebars templates replies on it to pre-compile. Of course, we do a lot of other stuff in grunt.
